## About

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. Dawei Zhou. My research lies at the intersection of **AI for Science** and **geometric deep learning**, with a focus on data-driven and knowledge-guided **mechanical metamaterial design**. I develop unified frameworks that integrate **3D topology**, **density conditions**, and **mechanical properties** for efficient and controllable material generation and evaluation.

My recent work explores the use of **diffusion models**, **symbolic reasoning**, and **human-in-the-loop systems** to enable automated hypothesis generation, structure refinement, and interactive exploration for scientific discovery.

## Research

### AI for Mechanical Metamaterial Discovery

My research goal is to build a general-purpose AI system that can reason about, generate, and evaluate mechanical metamaterials from a multi-modal and multi-objective perspective. Key areas include:
- **Unified generative models** for inverse and forward design of mechanical properties
- **3D geometric learning and diffusion** for topology generation
- **Human-AI collaborative frameworks** for scientific ideation
- **Benchmarks and toolkits** for robust and reproducible metamaterial ML evaluation
